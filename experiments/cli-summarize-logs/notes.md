## Run 001 — Blocked by authorization

The agent did not create any files.
No filesystem changes were observed.

Claude Code CLI requested explicit write permission approval
before proceeding with file creation.

This indicates that the agent execution was blocked by
an external authorization mechanism, not by internal reasoning
or execution failure.

This run validates the need for a first-class "blocked"
state in agent observability.
